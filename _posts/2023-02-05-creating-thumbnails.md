To create a thumbnail in GIMP: 
1. Find .jpg for the thumbnail
2. Open the image in GIMP by dragging the file into the toolbox
3. Use the scale tool to change the size of the image to the critical dimension
4. Right click the layer on which the image exists (should be the only layer)
    - select "Layer Boundary Size" 
5. In the pop-up window, set the size of the thumbnail under "Layer Size" 
    - Select "Center" in the Offset menu
    - Press "Resize" to finish
6. Click and drag the layer into the toolbox to open it in its own tab
7. Select File->Export As
    - name the file and set extension as .png so that the extra space around the thumbnail is blank instead of filled with the background color.
