This is my first post. I made this website mostly for myself so I can track things I'm interested in and be able to go back and check it out. I'll include random analysis of questions that I randomly think of in daily life. It'll usually have to do with things very relevant to my life like thinking of where to get LASIK eye surgery and the most cost effective way to finance it or what is the best strategy to raise your internal temperature in the sauna, with or without a layer of sweat on your body. I'll try to include references wherever possible for anyone to check my work.
