As I get older, I feel more of a drive to help those around me to not make the same mistakes I did. I want to tell people the type of things I wish someone told me in my past. This is especially true in fitness, but is also true in my personal life.

As documented in [link](http://example.com "Title"), I have had shoulder and back injuries. They have kept me out of the gym for about a year over the past 7 or so years. In that time, I've taken the time off necessary to improve my technique and incorporate things excersizes that help to keep me injury free into the future. I stretch, perform physical therapy excersizes (given to me by a professional), and constantly interragate my lifting form.

I'm very comfortable in the gym, and I feel confident while I'm there. This is from making slow progress and leaning proper technique and just a general knowledge of what I'm doing. I feel like everyone needs something like that, but I digress. This confidence has started to manifest as the confidence in my own opinions enough to give advice to newer lifters in the gym.

There are a few important things when considering giving advice to people you don't know at the gym.
1. Be humble
2. Be relatable
3. Encourage

First, to be humble is to not come in hot and immediately tell them they're wrong. It can be easy to point out all that is wrong with someone's form, but by being humble, you can appreciate why someone may be doing things differently than you.

Next, being relatable is an important part of not being shrugged off, in my opinion. If I ever go up to someone to correct their form, I'll typically say that I used to do the same thing and ended up injuring myself. This gives me some credibility, and puts us on the same team and makes the interaction much more positive (learned from experience).

Lastly, it is important to encourage the person. I'm passionate about fitness and think that everyone needs a physical outlet to relieve stress and give themselves something to strive for over time. Lifting weights has helped me build my confidence and gotten me through some tough, stressful times in my life.

People new to working out are the ones that are the most vulnerable to giving up. Being told you're doing everything wrong would be a great way to want to hang up your hat and never come back. It is so so important for any advice giving interaction to be positive and build the other person up to want to improve for their own sake instead of because they're embarrased because a stranger said they were doing something wrong. You can never know the impact of kind words of encouragement can have on someone. Especially someone who is going out of their comfort zone to go to a new gym and learn
