To remove hairs, the two most important tools are the "heal tool" for blending pixels together, and under the same menu is the "clone tool", which actually copies and pastes pixels from the target area onto the touched up area. The heal tool is good for small things, while the clone tool is better for areas with thicker hairs because it doesn't average with the pixels that used to be hair.
