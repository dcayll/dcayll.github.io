## Overview

This is my first post. I made this website mostly for myself so I can track things I'm interested in over time and be able to go back and check it out. Maybe I can help someone along the way as well. Maybe itâ€™s my own hubris thinking that other people might want to hear my opinion on things, but I believe that I am relatively well informed on things I'm interested in, and I feel obligated to share relevant knowledge with people if they ever ask me. I like that this website is a public place and it will force me to create things with organization and structure, a beginning and an end. I'll try to include references wherever possible for anyone to check my work.

## Fitness

I've been physically active for (mostly) my whole life, and fitness is one of my passions. I love to share my knowledge with others and invite friends to work out with me. I've been lifting weights since 2012, and it's been a long up and down journey full of cycles with good progress followed by injury and rehab and even slower progress back to the starting point. I'm humbled by the mistakes I've made and will continue to learn my entire life. The goal is to stay healthy for as long as possible. I'm not trying to live forever, but I want as many years as possible to be as high quality as possible. We lose muscle at a rate of 10%/decade as we age, and I'm hoping to get my initial number high enough so that I can squat down and pick up my grandkids at 80 and stave off the general pain associated with growing old.

### Bodybuilding

My fitness journey really started for the wrong reasons, but very common reasons for an awkward shy 15 year old. I wanted to get muscles to get girls and get respect from guys. Size was the only thing I cared about. That ended up biting me in the end, but I will never regret getting started that early because it is what created this lasting habit of working out in me.

### Mobility

My two major injuries are impingement in my left shoulder from weak rotator cuffs and tight lat, pec, and suprispinatus muscles. Basically my left shoulder is rotated forward and looks higher than my right when at rest. This reduces space in the front part of the shoulder and causes ligaments to become "impinged" and rub against bone, muscle, and other ligaments and get inflamed. This is a very common issue in weight lifters

### Cardio

I like to be as efficient as possible when doing cardio, so I mostly do HIIT training (zone 5 I think). And this is also only when I'm trying to cut down. I'd like to add in some zone 2 cardio in the near future if I can fit it into my schedule conveniently.

## Photography

I got a Sony a6100, and it is a great entry level camera so far. I picked it becuase it is a relatively small form factor and lenses are common for the sony E-mount size. I enjoy taking photos of nature and staging photos well when people ask me to take one for them (also complain when people misframe a photo I want taken). Recently, I haven't been using my Sony as much becuase, honestly, my iPhone takes pretty good pictures in most common scenarios. Many times even better than what I can do on the Sony. So I've shifted my photography focus onto things that the iPhone cant do (yet).

### Macro

Macro photography is taking pictures of very small things. I especially enjoy seeing the intricacies of flowers, plants, insects or other things we never think to examine up close. The way succulent leaves bud, the way a flower's pedal placement follow the fibonacci sequence. iPhone cameras don't have the close focus and zoom capabilities and it means I need my Sony. I haven't actually bought a macro lens yet, I just use a "close-up" filter which is a convex lens that introduces a diopter to the optical path (like corrective lenses), which changes the focal point of the image. In my case, it moves the focal point closer to the lens, so the sample can be placed closer to the lens and zoomed in better. I use this lens along with my kit telephoto lens to get the zoom required.

### Astro

Astrophotography means taking pictures of stars and other things in space. Last christmas I got a star tracker that follows the rotation of the earth when aligned correctly. This is necessary because the stars and nebulae are very dim and require very long exposures, sometimes from 5 min up to hours. This means the rotation of the earth makes the stars look like streaks in the image and limit your exposure time. It is a difficult and time consuming hobby because you need to be up late and keep your eyes on the weather forecast becuase clouds or humidity in the air can cause visibility issues. Also alignment of the camera is difficult and any misalignement can ruin the photos. But the size of the sensor and the apeture is directly proportional to the amount of light the camera can absorb, so the iPhone is very limited by a small sensor and small apeture so the Sony is necessary.

### Landscape

Landscape photography is what made me want to get my mirrorless camera, and a ultrawide angle lens (12mm f/2.0) is the first one I bought after my kit lenses. It has huge viewing angles, but the panoramic photo feature on iPhones is pretty darn good and beats the viewing angle of this lens.

### Portraits

I've only recently tried portraits, and they're hard. Lighting is important, and

### Photo editing

I've been learning how to use GIMP, which is the open source equivalent of Adobe photoshop. It has a rich user base and lots of youtube tutorials for beginners to learn. It may not be as user friendly as photoshop (never actually used it), but it is close, or so I hear.

## Blog

I have found that I actually like writing. Not the act of writing, but I like the process of refining my ideas and thinking about the best way to communicate an idea. Communicating your thoughts is just as important as having a complex thought to begin with. If you have great insights, but can never communicate them to someone else or even to your future self, then how great was that thought anyway? (i.e. if a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, does it make a sound?). This is my attempt at forcing myself to improve my communication, technical and otherwise.

### Engineering

I'm an engineer and a scientist, so I think about a lot of weird "what if's". I may perform some back of the envelope calculations to prove a curiosity of mine, and share my thought process. I've had pretty fruitful conversations with colleagues talking about how/why/where bubbles form in beer, example 2, example 3.

### Finances

I'm very interested in macroeconomics and monetary policy. I enjoy learning about large scale consequences created by monetary decisions made by people in various positions of power. I'm also interested in personal finance, and how to maximize the value of every dollar.

### Life

I will likely not include many personal details on this site, but I may try to distill down some personal insights I've gained over time. I'll try to keep from being preachy and self-riteous.

## Conclusion

I guess I'm a blogger now. Sounds weird to say, and I didn't even know that this was blogging. This is mostly a personal blog, but if my friends/family/colleagues/friendly strangers want to browse, it is welcome!
