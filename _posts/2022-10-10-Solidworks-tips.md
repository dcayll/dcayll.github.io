## Creating and using global variables

If you want to use global variables in an entire assembly, then you must use a global variables file to keep track. This means that you will no longer be able to edit the equations in the equation editor natively in solidworks. However, if you select the folder button to the right of the extension of the folder, you can adjust the variables in an external text editor.

When you finish adjusting, you must save the text file, and then select "import" in the equation editor. A dialogue will pop up to ask if you want to overwrite and remove duplicates from the text file. Select "No" or else this will delete all but the newest variable in the text file.
