I've already mentioned why I think writing is a great way to filter thoughts and clear out/ refine what's on my mind. It is great when there is a big issue on my mind and I need to fully flesh it out. However, in the absence of that, don't often deeply investigate my own thoughts and write. Its reserved for times when I'm experiencing intense feelings or trying to learn something deep. 

The hope in daily reflections and writings is to create a habit of clearly articulating things on my mind, big and small, in the hope that it comes easier. 

I will write about personal things, geopolitical, financial, economic, health, and anything that interests me. I will write in the mornings as part of my routine. At least 10 mins every day. I'm stacking this habit on top of my prayer habit and hopefully it will force me to wake up on time so I can complete all my morning routine of breakfast, prayer, and writing. I will keep my personal computer on at my new desk to lower the entry barrier. 

My goals are to refine the filter that is between my thoughts and my words. To refine my thoughts over time. Maybe I'll bring in external references as well. I may also fill in my book notes
