# Introduction
	- Everything goes around in a cycle. >100 year cycles with world powers, 100 year long term debt cycles, 8 year short term debt cycles, recessions etc. 
	- Prosperous times: depression/revolution times = 5:1
	- People generally expect future to be slightly different from near term past

# Ch 1: the big cycle in a tiny nutshell
	- Major empires of study:
		○ Last 3 reserve currencies: Dutch, British, and American 
		○ The other 6 significant empires in the past 500 years: Germany, France, Russia, India, Japan, China 
		○ Major Chinese empires since 600AD
	- Common thread in all empires- the struggle to make, take, and distribute wealth. 
		○ People with the wealth then own the means of wealth production. They work with those with power to set and entrench rules. 
		○ Then hard times hit them and they’re overextended and economic pain befalls everyone and a new world order takes shape
## understanding the big cycle
	- 3 major cycles making the big cycle:
		○ Long term debt and capital markets cycle, internal order/disorder, and external order/disorder
## Evolution, cycles, and the bumps along the way
	- Human productivity is the most important causal force for increasing world wealth and living standards over time. 
	- Evolution/cycles always trend upwards- like a corkscrew facing up and right
	- Industrial revolution took wealth creation away from landowners into hands of industrialists. Wealth and power now come from education, inventiveness, and capitalism. Gvt now works for them and not monarch’s anymore. 
## The cycles around the uptrend
	- Over time, winning formula is educated people being funded by capital markets, owning the means of production, and making profits. Over long run, capitalism creates wealth and opportunity gaps tho
	- Wealth gaps lead to conflict and debt/economic collapse. 
	- Economic and market declines ~3 years +/-2 years. Depends on speed of printing money to fill debt holes. 
	- Periods of destruction set stage for future prosperity that eventually is overextended in debt bubbles with inequality which produce new stress tests for world order
## past big cycle shifts in wealth and power
	- 
	
	- 
	- Netherlands, Uk, and US are 3 most recent reserve currencies
## eight determinants of wealth and power
	- 1) education, 2) competitiveness, 3) innovation and technology, 4) economic output, 5) share of world trade, 6) military strength, 7) financial center strength, and 8) reserve currency status.
	- 
## The Archetypical Big cycle
### The rise 
	- effective leadership, good education, low inequality, good work ethic, infrastructure investments, developing capital markets, world reserve currency development
### The top
	- Richer=less competitive 
		○ compared to places with cheaper labor. 
		○ Others copy too
		○ People work less hard and enjoy more leisure, more vulnerable to challenges
	- Bet on good times continuing -> borrowings more
	- Wealth gap grows and regulatory capture by the rich and powerful
	- If living standards continue to grow, things don’t boil over yet
	- Large debts from foreign lenders, short term liquidity, but long term currency is weakened bc of domestic overconsumption and spending on military conflict
### The Decline
#### Internally:
	- Comes from internal economic weakness together with internal fighting or costly external fighting, or all
	- Large debts incentivize money printing. Devalues currency and increase inflation
	- Creates internal conflict between rich and poor and political extremism from both sides
	- Flight of wealth to avoid overtaxing. Shrinks productivity, further lower tax revenue
		○ Democracy most challenged here bc strong populist leader promises order. Sometimes civil war
#### Externally
	- International conflict possible if another power with big military 
		○ Requires leading power to spend more on military as internal conditions worsen
	- When debt and currency holders lose faith, they sell and cycle ends
