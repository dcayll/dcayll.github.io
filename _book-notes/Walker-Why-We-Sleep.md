# Ch 1: To sleep...

- As sleep deficits increase, so do risk for: Altzheimers, heart disease, and weight gain hormones

# Ch 2: Caffiene, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

- 2 things lead to sleepiness: 
  1. Circadian rhythm
  2. Sleep pressure from a chemical adenosine
- Circadian rhythm controls:
  - Time preference to eat and drink
  - pee
  - body temperature
  - metabolic rate
- Experiment determined that even in full darkness, we have normal sleep/wake cycles. Internal clock =/= 24 hrs. Usually longer. Depends on age
- Sun is not the only clock for circadian rhythm
  - food, exercise, temperature are also clocks
- Body temperature fluctuates over time. 
  - peak at 4pm, trough at 2am
  - fluctuates whether asleep or not

- Chronotype 
  - is genetic (sleep time preferences)
  - night owls are forced to wake early against their internal clocks. 
    - therefore, less sleep, more health problems, perform worse @ work
  - Variability of chronotype helped in evolution. People in clan to keep watch

- Melatonin 
  - regulates timing of sleep, not generation of sleep
  - unregulated. pill dosage unreliable
  - is released through the night. Reduction in body signals wakefulness

- Jet lag 
  - body can only correct internal clock ~1 hr/day
  - traveling east, jet lag is harder to correct
    - easier to stay up late vs. sleep earlier
    - also bc internal clock >24hrs
  - flight crews have shrunken learning and memory areas in brain bc circadian rhythm super off

- Sleep pressure
  - Adenosine builds up all day and pressure builds to sleep after 12-16 hrs awake
    - caffeine bonds to adenosine sites & reduces sleep pressure
      - half life = 5-7 hrs. may produce insomnia
      - Enzyme that breaks down caffeine varies genetically
      - crash happens bc adenosine finally binds after caffeine is digested. Bonds harder after caffeine is digested
      - sleep pressure & circadian rhythm independent but correlated. 

- Pulling an all nighter increases adensoine continually, but circadian rhythm continues
  - urge to sleep can decrease next day bc of circadian rhythm
