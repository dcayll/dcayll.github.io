## Ch 1: To sleep

- As sleep deficits increase, so do risk for: Alzheimer's, heart disease, and weight gain hormones

## Ch 2: Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

- 2 things lead to sleepiness:
  1. Circadian rhythm
  2. Sleep pressure from a chemical adenosine
- Circadian rhythm controls:
  - Time preference to eat and drink
  - pee
  - body temperature
  - metabolic rate
- Experiment determined that even in full darkness, we have normal sleep/wake cycles. Internal clock =/= 24 hrs. Usually longer. Depends on age
- Sun is not the only clock for circadian rhythm
  - food, exercise, temperature are also clocks
- Body temperature fluctuates over time
  - peak at 4pm, trough at 2am
  - fluctuates whether asleep or not

- Chronotype
  - is genetic (sleep time preferences)
  - night owls are forced to wake early against their internal clocks
    - therefore, less sleep, more health problems, perform worse @ work
  - Variability of chronotype helped in evolution. People in clan to keep watch

- Melatonin
  - regulates timing of sleep, not generation of sleep
  - unregulated. pill dosage unreliable
  - is released through the night. Reduction in body signals wakefulness

- Jet lag
  - body can only correct internal clock ~1 hr/day
  - traveling east, jet lag is harder to correct
    - easier to stay up late vs. sleep earlier
    - also bc internal clock >24hrs
  - flight crews have shrunken learning and memory areas in brain bc circadian rhythm super off

- Sleep pressure
  - Adenosine builds up all day and pressure builds to sleep after 12-16 hrs awake
    - caffeine bonds to adenosine sites & reduces sleep pressure
      - half life = 5-7 hrs. may produce insomnia
      - Enzyme that breaks down caffeine varies genetically
      - crash happens bc adenosine finally binds after caffeine is digested. Bonds harder after caffeine is digested
      - sleep pressure & circadian rhythm independent but correlated

- Pulling an all nighter increases adenosine continually, but circadian rhythm continues
  - urge to sleep can decrease next day bc of circadian rhythm

## Ch 3: Defining and Generating Sleep

- Senses still work while asleep, but thalamus in brain blocks them
- We can determine time while asleep unconsciously
  - but time in dreams feel longer than actual time
    - in rat experiment, brain signals recorded in maze
      - in sleep, same waves present, but @ slower speed
      - evidence time moves slower in dreams

- 2 types of sleep: REM & Non-REM. cycles and repeats overnight
  - NREM has 4 stages, each harder to wake from than the last
  - Cycle takes ~90 mins in humans
    - other animals typically have shorter cycles
      - best correlation is to width of brain stem
    - cycle more NREM heavy at first, then more REM at end of night
      - could have to do with consolidating memory
        - NREM takes out unnecessary connections, REM strengthens connections
  - Sleeping late & waking normal makes you loose NREM @ beginning of night
  - Sleeping normal & waking earlier makes you loose REM @ end of night

- Brain signals when awake are asynchronous ~30-40 Hz
  - bc brain is working fast to keep up with sensory input
- Brain signals in deep NREM sleep slow down 10x & are more repeatable
  - hidden in slow activity are "sleep spindles" which are occasional fast cycles
    - helps to reduce external noise that could wake us
  - these signals come from center of frontal lobes and radiate front to back
    - neurons all fire in sync
  - thalamus cut off senses in NREM - explains no dreams, unconsciousness, and loss of time
  - slow waves can travel farther in the brain and link different parts in NREM

- REM is very similar to wakefulness brain signals
  - **Wakefulness = reception; REM = integration; NREM = reflection**
    - dreams in REM are thoughts/memories being broadcast into senses for building more accurate models of the world
  - body completely limp in REM - good indicator of REM
    - so we can act out dreams in head and not in real life

## Ch 4: Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain

- Every animal sleeps - insects, reptiles, mammals, invertebrates. sleep >500M years old
  - even bacteria have active and passive phases corresponding to day/night
    - maybe sleep evolved first, then wakefulness?
- big differences between animal sleep times
  - relationship between brain/nervous system size vs. total body mass is an ok predictor
  - also depends on diet, social networks, predator/prey balance, metabolic rate

- REM is a recent evolution of sleep - only birds & mammals
  - dolphins & whales don't have REM; also seals when in ocean, but when they sleep on land, they have REM
    - REM = paralysis -> might kill them in water, or REM different & not as detectable
  - bird & mammal REM evolved separately - also some proto-REM in lizards
  - After all-nighter, NREM rebounds first, then REM in following nights
    - both important. sleep lost is never fully recovered.

- Methods of sleep b/t animals very different
  - dolphins & whales have 1/2 of brain sleep at a time. to keep moving & talking
  - birds sleep in groups. inner ones = full brain sleep; outer ones = half brain sleep to keep watch
    - REM sleep can't be split b/t sides of brain. whole brain required

- Differences in resilience to loosing sleep
  - famine reduces need for sleep in exchange for foraging for food.
  - migratory birds sleep in-flight for seconds in power naps
    - if deprived during migration season, they're fine, but deprivation out of season very bad for them

- We evolved to sleep at night and nap in afternoon after lunch ~30-40 mins
  - hunter-gathers still do this & siesta culture from this.
    - 37% increased risk of heart disease for people who stopped afternoon naps in greece, compared to those who kept it.
      - confounding variables?

- Human sleep different than apes & other primates. more REM & shorter total duration
  - sleeping in trees was to avoid predators, but REM paralysis bad for balance
    - once homo erectus invented fire & slept on ground, more efficient sleep started.
  - REM helps process complex emotions - emotional IQ of an individual increases with more REM
    - over time, as everyone has increased emotional IQ, complex societies could develop
  - REM also links parts of the brain to create overarching insights. i.e. general intelligence & creativity
    - NREM only puts memories into long term storage

## Ch 5: Changes in Sleep over Lifespan

- Fetuses sleep a lot. by 23rd week, REM & NREM present
  - no paralyzing in REM for fetuses though
  - REM increases to 12 hrs/day before birth. most ever in lifetime
    - important for maturation of brain - synaptogenesis
    - if REM is interrupted in-utero or in newborn, development is stunted
      - when sleep resumes, lost ground can't be regained
    - autism linked to weaker circadian rhythm & less sleep than regular
      - esp. 30-50% less REM. causality unclear.
  - babies of alcoholic mothers have less REM & lower quality REM
    - alcohol is best REM-blocker
    - this linked to higher incidence of autism
  - after nursing, babies usu go into REM; if mom's milk has alcohol, REM is disturbed
    - 20-3-% reduction. some is regained after alcohol out of system, but not all

- babies & young kids have polyphasic sleep: many short bouts with loud wakefulness between
  - older the baby gets, the longer and more stable sleep becomes
  - **tip:** put kid to sleep when they're drowsy, not when already asleep.
    - helps build ability to self soothe
- circadian rhythm part of brain not developed until ~1yr
- by 4 yrs - bi-phasic sleep (night with a nap)
- infants 50/50 REM/NREM with 14 hrs total. 5 year old: 70/30 NREM/REM with 11 hrs; adults 80/20 is adult average

- NREM spikes late childhood & adolescence - correlates with decreasing REM
  - trimming connections & strengthens others in NREM for efficiency
  - NREM ramps back down after early adulthood
  - brain maturation happens back to front. visual & spacial perception & critical thinking and decision making last
  - NREM is causal in the development of critical thinking and decision making
    - NREM disturbed in rats using caffeine and development stunted
      - similar disturbances are linked with schizophrenia
        - abnormal synaptic pruning in frontal lobe
  - also, teens circadian rhythm shifted later; kids earlier w/r/t/ adults
    - may be to give teens practice being independent @ night away from parents

- older adults still need as much sleep as younger ones; its just harder to obtain
  - rem stays steady, but NREM decreases with aging. by 70 y.o., 80-90% reduction
    - some bad health can be attributed to bad sleep with age
  - insufficient sleep correlated with higher mortality risk, depression, and forgetfulness
  - circadian rhythm shifts earlier in old people. causes late afternoon sleepiness, which reduces sleep pressure and night sleep quality; then wake early b/c circadian rhythm
  - the parts of brain that ignite deep NREM sleep are the first to deteriorate with old age
  - people given a memory task at night, then slept and re-tested in morning
    - older people and those with greatest loss of deep sleep remembered the least
  - old people need more sleep because if more sleep artificially generated, their mental performance is better
    - they just can't create that sleep on their own.

## Ch 6: Your Mother and Shakespeare Knew the Benefits of Sleep

- Sleep is important in memory- like a file storage/exchange system
  - sleep helps to empty the queue of info going from short to long term memory
    - limited amount of short term memory
    - stage 2 NREM sleep spindle intensity predicts learning restoration
  - short term storage in hippocampus; long term in cortex
  - old people have less sleep spindles therefore worse file transfer and memory
  - spindles usually occur in late morning hours - miss if not sleeping enough

- Sleep after learning helps to cement it into long-term memory
  - fact-based learning helps to cement it into long-term memory
    - fact-based recall improvements come from NREM - abundant in first part of the night.
  - link between NREM and memory recall very strong & predictive
    - naps as short as 20 mins with NREM even work
    - forgotten facts can be recalled after too.
  - using transcranial direct current brain stimulation (tDCS) during NREM, people can remember 2x more (if in sync with waves already present)
    - same stimulation in REM or awake does nothing
    - sound can do the same to enhance waves
    - swaying in sleep also produces 2x spindles in NREM
  - Playing sound related to things you want to remember during NREM will help them be remembered better (doesn't work in REM)

- Selectively forgetting also important in sleep. - makes space for new stuff
  - by curing what should be remembered/forgotten while awake, sleep listens and acts appropriately.
  - quick sleep spindles in NREM help to forget. frontal lobe is gatekeeper

- Different types of memory. skill memory, different than fact recall (subject of all memory talk until this point)
  - "muscle memory" is improved by practice. further improved by practice and sleep
  - unlike textbook memory that goes from short to long-term storage, skill memory goes to a place where unconscious skills go. instincts.
    - comes from stage 2 NREM - usually lasts 2 hrs of 8 hr sleep; many spindles present.
      - spindles concentrate in areas where they're needed.
        - i.e. if today many motor skills were learned, that part of brain gets spindles

- Under-sleeping related to many decreases in physical performance - time to exhaustion, vertical jump, increased lactic acid buildup, decrease in lung efficiency, increased injury risk.

- Stage 2 NREM spikes in babies learning ot walk. Likely because they're learning new motor control skills.
