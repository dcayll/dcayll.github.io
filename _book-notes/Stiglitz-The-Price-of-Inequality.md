## Ch 1: America's 1% Problem

- Top 1% own >1/3 of the nation's wealth; 1/5 of the nation's income
- Get outsized gains in income (65% of total gain from '02-'07)
- Bottom-middle grew faster in the past, not so since ~2000
  - Past 30 years:
    - bottom 90%: wages increased by 15%
    - top 1% wages increased by 150%
    - top 0.1% wages increased by 300%
- Bottom and middle have wealth in homes, not stock/ bond investments
- 37% of americans below poverty line (before government programs)
- stronger link between parental education with kids education in US than in Europe

## Ch 2: Rent Seeking and the Making of an Unequal Society

- _Rent seeking_ - getting more income by grabbing larger share of wealth, not creating it
  - Taking wealth from society destroys value. i.e. monopoly restricting productivity
    - This can be limited by government policy, but rent seekers lobby government
    - Big in financial sector. Asymmetry of information taking advantage of the poor
- Rent seeking includes getting resource rights cheap and maximizing profits
- Big corporations lobby hard for their industries; bankers have 2.5 lobbyists per U.S. representative

### Government Munificence

- Government procurement -> in drugs or defense - paying above costs for stuff
- deregulation
- Granting natural resource rights
  - auctions are best. i.e. EM spectrum rights
- Tariffs - government giving unfair advantages to US businesses
  - sometimes invest in R&D and increases efficiency, but also gives "old and tired" industries postponement of inevitable failure

## Ch 3: Markets and Inequality

- Changes in economy. i.e. US manufacturing was a large middle-class workforce, and now its moved to China and jobs that replace them aren't as well paying.
- Also tech reduces demand for low skill labor
- Not a given that innovation will be skill based. Can be resource based?

### Globalization

- Argues that the free flow of labor is more important than free flow of capital
  - low wage workers have very low bargaining power. Corporations can go elsewhere and get cheap labor

### Unions

- Union membership down 10% from 1980 to 2010.
  - Says labor flexibility isn't as important as strong worker protection.
- Historically, compensation and productivity moved up together. Not anymore. Wages stagnant.
- Capital gains tax 15%. Benefits top most
- to 1% overall tax rate gone from 37% to 30% from 1979 to now
  - average from 22.2% - 20.4%

## Ch 4: Why it Matters

- Top 1% saves 20% of income; if 5% of that 20% is taken and given to middle income and the poor (1% of their total income), it would turn into 1.2-2% of their income being spread into the economy because of recirculation of money
- Low capital and dividend taxes in Bush era. Companies paid out high dividends because they thought it wouldn't last
  - Means smaller cash reserves and less investment in general (outside of real estate)
- Deregulation serves short term self interest and profits over long term social and economic consequences
- IMF states longer growth spells are correlated with more equal income distribution. Inequality reduces efficiency and productivity.
  - Less public investment because of wealthy not wanting to sponsor it via taxes.
  - Basic research is funded by gvt too.
  - $3.2B spent on lobbying in 2011
- **Rent seeking:**  waste resources for more monopoly power and preferential tax/political treatment
  - scarcity of oil not priced. Oil not sustainable and therefore prices should reflect that, but they don't.
- inequality arises because private rewards differ from social returns
- Hunger impairs productivity because you're forced to spend limited cognitive resources on saving money and feeding your family, not on stuff to get them out of the situation.
- Happy workers are the most productive
  - In experiment: Individuals in same job, 1/2 see increase wage and 1/2 see decrease wage:
    - Decreases overall productivity because lower wage condition decreases productivity more than higher wage increases productivity
- **Consumerism:** long term relationship between GDP and wellbeing?
  - maybe not. Relative income (i.e. keeping up with the Joneses) has people overextending financially.
- Higher social protections may increase willingness for high-risk, high-reward ventures
- Incentive pay imperfect. Rewards quantity over quality
  - better would be to compare performance to people in similar positions or performance over time
  - i.e. bankers making short sighted, risky investments in '08
- Most are motivated by intrinsic rewards (achievement) over extrinsic rewards (wealth)
  - Also motivated to make the team proud
    - Companies with shared profits did better in downturns than those without.
- Progressive taxation:
  - fairness and perception of fairness increases productivity
