text describing shoulder Anatomy and issues

## Shoulder Overview

The shoulder is a complicated joint and is relatively unstable becuase it must allow for a large range of motion. this gives us a lot of arm freedom, but it makes us prone to injury.

## Dysfunction Discription

I suffer from impingement in the front of my left shoulder. I've suffered from this since I was about 19 years old. Impingement means there is rubbing of tendons which can cause inflamation and pain.

### Posture

Posture is very imporant as it creates a habitual position for your body to rest in. If it is a biomechanically stable position, there will be no pain, but if it is pathological, pain can develop over time.

### Tightness

With bad posture comes lack of range of motion in certain joints. In the shoulder specifically, anterior rotation causes the suprispinatus to be tight.

### Weakness

Weakness in my external rotators and serratus anterior, all of which serve to stablize your shoulder, has helped cause the joint pain I feel.
