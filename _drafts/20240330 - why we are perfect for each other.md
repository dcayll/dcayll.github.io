Beh,

In my prayer this morning I was moved with a deep love for you. We are made for each other. We are so different but we complement each other so well. You are so detail oriented and are very driven and on fire and you get things done and plan ahead. This requires you to take everything very seriously and you worry too much and place the weight of the world on your back for you alone to carry. You see the world through a lens of the problems you need to solve and you sometimes miss the beauty and wonder of the world around you

On the other hand, I’m more delusional in a different way. I don’t plan as much and I push things to the last minute and I believe that if my heart is in the right place then God is on our side and will help us prevail in all that we do. And I don’t mean that I will lay on my butt all day and wait for things to happen. It means that I believe if I make all the correct strides and push towards the right goals then good fortune will come my way. 

We are perfect for each other because we are different. God has placed us in each others lives to continually give each other the sacrament of marriage every day for the rest of our lives. We are supposed to rub off on each other and bring each other closer to our best selves

You will help me and our family plan ahead and keep the big picture dream. I will help you zoom out of your narrow focus of things not going according to your plan. 

This requires patience from both of our ends. I need patience and empathy to stand with you when you feel the weight of the world on your shoulders. Instead of making you feel like youre alone and your feelings are invalid and you are crazy. I am the problem there. 

And also you need patience to trust God and those around you a bit more. Trust that if you have the right intentions and are pushing towards the right goals there is nothing that can stand in your way. 

We need to build bridges not walls. We need to bring each other in to the others way of thinking. We can’t just close off and say the other is ridiculous or irresponsible or crazy and trust that we are the one that is right. 

We need to begin from our trust in God. That although we are both flawed in different and varied ways, he has placed us here in this moment for a reason and to learn a lesson. His constant divine presence in our lives guides us through the easy times as well as the hard times. Both are blessings and both are necessary for our personal growth and as a married couple. 

The difficult times the past couple days have been a green flag for me more than anything. Yes we have a lot to learn about each other and we need to clear off some of our rough edges, but we are two puzzle pieces that fit together perfectly. We are different in all ways that can help bring the best out of the other. 

We need to improve our communication and the way we frame conflict and how we move through it but I feel vindicated that we are meant to be together. Marriage and love is not meant to be easy but it is meant to be worth it. 

I have a bunch of baggage I need to work through to be the most supportive spouse I can be and I’m deeply motivated to so that I can be there for you in the ways you need me to be.
