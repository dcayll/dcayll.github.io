I pray for a healthy baby but it is something out of our control. We can only hope and pray

We should be praying for acceptance for whatever God decides to bless us with. All children are a blessing and Ceci will be no matter what. Praying to see through any struggles for the lesson we can take from them. 

Diego’s heath issues brought your parents closer to God and he was a miracle that surprised everyone.

Isabel says I need to accept the fact that everything might not go well, but I accept the fact that I have no control over that and that I trust God to prepare me for whatever comes. He wouldn’t put anything in front of us that we can’t handle.
