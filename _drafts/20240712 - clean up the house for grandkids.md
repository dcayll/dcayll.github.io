I love you guys and want yall to live a long peaceful life. I can tell that the mess is something you recognize as a problem but it feels too big for yall to start anywhere and begin to clean. So you avoid it and donâ€™t start

I will have kids in the next few years and I want to visit and bring them around and stay at the house. If I did now, I would not feel comfortable bringing them around and letting them go around on their own. It would be nerve wracking. It would be like us at grandmothers house and the kids would get into everything.
