Do we need a justification for wanting to have children? Why do people think we do? Why do people say they dont want to bring a kid into the world which is doing downhill? Why do people think everything is worse than it has been in the past? Where did this pessimism come from? Loss of religiosity?

Optimistic and religious people think their child could make the world a better place and the nonreligious think the world will make the kid crumble and not have the skills to cope. 

It is a biological drive to have kids. Is that not a moral drive as well? Why did we have kids in the past? More workers for the farm propagate our beliefs into the next generation. Strengthen our clan against opposition. Help each other feed our clan. Social security. Kids take care of parents. Kids contribute to wider society in a better way and better fit as parents. 

What is different now than back then? Less war. More democracy, more wealth. More mental health issues pursuing wealth and power

Why did we pursue that less in the past? Less opportunity. Now we have more opportunity but it feels like things are stacked against us. Previous kings would fight to gain power and sovereignty. Way more likely for draft and slavery. 

Why does now feel so bad? With market economy comes inequality. No barometer for level of inequality compared to previous times. Also the type can change over time. More religious persecution in the past. More corporate capture now than in the past? Compare to guilder age. 

What suffering does bringing a kid into today entail?  Political winds to the right. Nationalist uprising across the world. Less globalization. Higher prices of goods. Lower affordability. Asset price inflation, and soon deflation? Less economic opportunity compared to previous (our) generation. 

Asset holders (boomers) in us and China will transfer large amounts of wealth in the next 20 years. Already starting. Will exasperate inequality. May juice spending. Bring up inflation. But US is a democracy and things will bend and change before they break. Other times of extreme change were handled. Some of those mechanisms are being torn down and also repurposed to bring up a new social elite. Democrats close to power with cronie billionaires donating to them for extra regulation so cement their leads in business. 

How will more kids help this situation? Next innovators and problem solvers and activists need to be born now for the next generation. We are inheriting an imperfect system that can change to make things better and we need the people with the will to do it. They should have your values and understanding so they can make the changes and innovations required. 

Steel man is that they won’t have the opportunity to make those changes and they will be slaves of the system. How to change that opinion? It is a deep pessimism.
