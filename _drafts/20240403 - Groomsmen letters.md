Hi Mark,

Thanks for being my groomsman. Isabel says you're our unofficial best man. I really appreciate you doing the toast and always reaching out to see if you can help. I'm extremely blessed to have met you and had the privilege to live with you for the last 2 years. Some of my fondest memories of my time in grad school are sitting on the couch downstairs and talking with you about any and everything while I learn the entirety of world history (lmao). Living alone this past year has been a bit sad because I've been missing times like that. 

We will always stay in touch. And I will always stick my neck out for you in any way that I can. Come to DFW!!! No pressure though. I know you'll be successful anywhere you go and I'm always praying for the best for you and Adrienne. You both deserve the best. 

Best,
David


Hi Matt,

Thanks for being my groomsman. I'm so blessed and honored we've stayed in touch all these years since ASU. 10 years and counting. We've both grown into ourselves in this time and I'm thankful for the meaningful conversations we've had along the way as we grow up little by little. Thanks for including me in all the trips we took in college and welcoming me into your home for thanksgiving, I am grateful for you letting me into your circle at ASU. 

I'm sad I moved away right as you moved into your boyfriend era, but we will stay in touch I'm excited to get to know you and Jenna as a couple!


Hi Zain, 

Thank you for being my best man. I'm so blessed to have you in my life. You helped me through a difficult time that opened up my life to Isabel and this very bright future I have ahead of me. You have been a steadfast moral anchor and I know I can talk to you about anything and all you'll do is call me gay (maybe). 

I wish we were in the same place and you could get to know Isabel better and I could get to know Lavanya, but we'll have our whole lives for that. I'm also here for you through it all like you have been for me and you'll stay in my prayers brother. 





Hi Diego

Thank you for
