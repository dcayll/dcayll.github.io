Isa & Ceci

You are both so loved. My Mind is racing all the time and I’m thinking about yall. 

Ceci you didn’t kick as much yesterday according to your mother. I said it was normal but I have no idea. I think it’s a good default to assume everything is healthy but we have no idea. What is the threshold for out of the ordinary? Isabel’s feelings are exaggerated , so how do I react to them? Cool and collected, unworried? Or do I affirm and force extra vigilance? Will I hurt you? 

Isabel you’re very strong and principled and thoughtful. I wouldn’t want anybody else to carry our babies. Your body is a miracle and Ceci is well cared for

I’m scared but I can show you that I’m scared because it will scare you. But I do have a trust in God and in us that we can handle everything that comes our way. 

I would be very scared knowing I have a major surgery coming up in 2 days but you’re carrying yourself with grace and strength with that coming up. Ceci will inherit that strength

I take that strength you’re showing and try to mirror it back to you for times when you don’t feel it yourself. Like the 3 legs of a stool. When you aren’t filling one up, I can pick up the slack and bring you there. 

I need to get better at expressing those feelings to you but they’re there. I do worry but it feels like I shouldn’t be. 

When I pray I used to imagine myself in a matrix-style fully infinite white room to imagine the vastness of God and humble me, but now I imagine you me and ceci together in that room. Our family has become the unit I view myself through with relation to God. We make his will done together by our relationship together and with what we teach Ceci. 

Everybody says our lives are going to change. First couple months you’ll question your decisions and then after it will become abundantly clear how rewarding raising children is. 

Im worried that those first few months wil make me jaded. 

We’re in the hospital. Everything feels surreal. This is the one decision in this world that can not be taken back. This is a commitment for our entire lives and it can’t be undone. 

It will change me and what I value and hold dear. What I think about when I wake up in the middle of the night.
