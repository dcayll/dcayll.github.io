Direction comes from aligning your actions to your goals. You work in a consistent direction. Not necessarily a precise location since you don’t know everything. 

Small wins compound on each other and if they’re in a consistent direction then you gain confidence and momentum in achieving your goals. 

There are only 2 kinds of people: those who do and those who do not. Nobody is special and can get away with no hard work. Anybody successful has worked hard for it. 

The worst thing you can do is waste your time. No direction is a bad direction. The worst thing is to be stagnant and not progress. Time is the only thing you can’t get back. 

Being humble is important because you don’t know what you don’t know and you can’t reject any opportunity immediately. 

You put up a huge barrier of a PhD for you to do what you want to do but it’s artificial and unnecessary. You can get started today doing what you’re passionate about. The barrier was an excuse for you to not do anything today. It give you a dopamine hit for every time you talked about what you wanted to do and made you feel smart and better than people without a PhD. Fake barrier. 

There’s careers and jobs that you can get now that are aligned with what you want so you can start learning what you don’t know. Being convinced you know it all and not being humble has forced you to say you “need a PhD before I start doing anything in the future”. And has been the reason you’re stuck for the past few years. 

The most important thing is getting in reps and learning along the way. Action. You need to start making decisions. Indecision is a decision. Indecision is a decision to waste your life-energy on bs that doesn’t contribute to your goals. You have too much time to think about bs and that’s making you depressed. You have so much time you ruminate on your bosses and it affects your quality of life. 

If you had more going on in your life, you would be worrying about more important things and not getting in your own head about pointless things. This is why antidepressants can be temporary. They help get you out of this slump so you can start putting your energy in a good direction and the positive momentum will motivate you intrinsically. That doesn’t happen without starting with consistent sustained action. 

Clock is ticking. There is no time to waste. 

Freedom requires responsibility. Freedom isn’t the ability to do whatever you want. Addicts are free to do whatever they want but they aren’t free. They can’t choose to act in a way that aligns with their goals and morals. They can only choose one thing, which is to use. Being free requires responsibility to earn a roof over your head and food for your mouth. You can apply to any job you want and build towards any future you want. 

God is the one with the master plan. You don’t know what he’s going to put in your life in the future that will change your path. But you know what’s in front of you now and he gave you the spirit to discern what is in front of you. You follow the holy spirit and pray about your initial direction and keep discerning along the way all the time. Nothing is set in stone
