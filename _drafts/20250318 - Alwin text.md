I’ve been distant this past year because of what happened at my wedding. I’m not sure if you remember, but you were almost bragging to people about what happened with Genie. 

I feel extremely disrespected on my own behalf and on behalf of my family and my wife. It took a lot to invite you to our wedding. I took a chance, and you let me down. 

I love you dude and I also really wish things were different. I wish we could go back to how things were in high school and college. Back to being brothers. But it’s hard when stuff like this happens. For my own sanity, I feel like I needed to keep some distance. Every time I think about us and our relationship, what to say to you, if/when I should respond to your messages, I become super distraught and want to disengage and avoid the subject altogether. 

I’ve felt a huge calling to repair things with us over the past few years because you’re crazy important to me too. I’ve pushed past the discomfort to help our healing. 

I’ve been on the other side of not too different circumstances in the past and it sucks to be cut out with no recourse. That feeling has pushed me to look towards my relationships to more forgiving, more empathetic towards those who have wronged me. 

You don’t know how many times I’ve written and rewritten this letter to you. I’ve spent days in prayer thinking about how to respond. I know you’re hurting and want things to get better. And I really do too. 

But I also need to think about my family now and I really don’t know if I can put in all that effort like I have in the past. My emotional bandwidth is a valuable resource and I already feel like I’m not giving enough of it to Isabel and spreading myself thin in other ways. Every time I think of our relationship and the way I wish it was I’m brought back into hurt. It takes away from my time with Isabel and can’t spend the emotional bandwidth with her and eventually our expected baby (in october)

I think things could still be on the mend if things at the wedding didn’t turn out the way they did. I’m not sure if drinking has something to do with it, but I’ve been in/heard of enough stories to think there may be a connection. The guy who does this at their best friend’s wedding isn’t the same guy I’ve known for my whole life. I don’t believe it is who you are. There’s something in you that comes out when you drink, and he may have come out that time 6 years ago as well. 

I pray for you often. I believe in you and your strength. I believe you have a strong moral character 99% of the time, but there are cracks that come out in times of weakness. 

I’m not sure what things look like moving forward. I needed time to think which is why I took so long to respond. I want to stay in each others lives, but there’s a point where everybody reaches their emotional limit, and I feel very close to mine. Not sure if I can handle another setback like at my wedding. I need to look out for those around me who rely on me. The door isn’t completely closed, but it’s very guarded right now. Sorry for such a long message but I wanted to get everything out.
