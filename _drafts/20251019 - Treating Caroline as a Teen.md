Caroline, 

I know I’ve treated you like a child. Assuming standards for you are better than the ones you set for yourself.

But even if you do what you think the family wants which is to break up with Benjamin, then it would be for the wrong reasons. It would not serve to improve standards for yourself or stand up for yourself. It would be the opposite. It would be you once again giving up control to your family and undermine your own decision making and morality. 

My own morality and judgement came from making decisions for myself. Not being pushed around to make the “correct” decisions by others. Nothing sticks unless we do it ourselves. You know this already but I need to learn it from the other side now. As a parent you’re giving me the practice to be understanding and learn not to impose my will and fracturing our future relationship for what seems like a quick win now. 

Where does that line lie? I know children can’t make decisions for themselves but adults must make all their decisions. It will be hard to learn that for Ceci. Thanks for giving me practice. 

I do trust your morals and values. You just need to exercise them in the real world to solidify them. And by me acting the way I was is handicapping you from doing that. I’m not your father and even if I was I shouldn’t be imposing this on you.
