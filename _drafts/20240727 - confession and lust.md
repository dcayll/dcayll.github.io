I’ve been a slave to lust since middle school when I discovered porn. When I felt rejected or stressed, I could always turn to it and get my quick gratification. In the beginning it didn’t hurt anyone, but I later learned it definitely hurt me and made me less able to date successfully since I always had an alterior motive. 

When Isabel  and I started dating I was 90 days clean from p&m. I felt clean and like the shame had begun to wash off of me. I had clear eyes and knew that I wanted to be serious with her for the right reasons. 

Porn now feels like the first steps into infidelity. Seeing other women as sexual objects also makes me see my own wife as a sexual object sometimes. 

==Matthew 5:28 says, "But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart"==. That is all that porn is, looking at women with lustful intent. That can bleed into real life as well as a second step on the road to adultery. The root is seeing women as sexual objects. 

Women and men are both created in Gods image and need to learn from each other and temper each others longings. We become one in marriage and now move through all things together. If one sees the other as a means to an end (sexually) then we can get stuck in a cycle reinforcing the wrong pathways. 

The past couple weeks I’ve felt a bit of distance. Maybe from the sex being different and Isabel not getting fulfillment and having it be only for me. Maybe it’s also comes from me not wanting to go out and do things like walk around the stores or pouting when we go dancing. My solution is to get her to come. Her solution may be for me to do more things she wants to do. 

We need to talk about the root of it. When do I feel connection? When do you? 

During sex for me yes. When coming yes. When I confess things to you like I did last night. When we do our hobbies together. I love taking care of our plants together. I think the same for you but it’s shopping and dancing? Going on walks

Sex is not the issue. Connection is the issue. My viewing porn and my oversexualization makes me think sex is the issue. It’s not. Me being satisfied sexually may make me seem more peaceful but maybe it will breed resentment in you? 

We need more shared hobbies. Tennis, volunteering, bible study? Exploring new areas. We need to schedule times and make concrete plans.
