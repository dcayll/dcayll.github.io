Following God can feel like going out on a limb sometimes. He’s calling you to higher and higher things and if you look down you can get scared of the heights. 

Imagine you’re taking steps on an invisible staircase to follow Gods will. Similar to Peter(?) who was walking on water to reach Jesus, but began to sink once he began to doubt, we can begin to fall if we look down and keep our eyes off of Jesus. We follow his call but need to keep our eyes up to the higher calling

When we follow for long enough, we can get higher and higher on the invisible staircase that to look away and fall can be life changing.
