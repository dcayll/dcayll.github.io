Drinking is a problem, there is a dark side of you that comes out when you’re drunk. Same guy that cheated and same guy that bragged about it on my wedding day to our friends. 

I’ve been distant because of how disrespectful you were at my wedding talking about issues in our past at my wedding. I didn’t get much time to talk to you but I remember you were pretty drunk and ended up going back upstairs early. 

The Alwin I know is the one from high school and college who had integrity and I could talk to about anything. 

Something changed after med school and after our shit happened. Something dark came out, especially when you drink. I haven’t seen it directly, but I’ve been involved in and heard about enough incidents to know that something that isn’t the real you comes out. 

You domt deserve an explanation on why I’m distant but I’ll give it to you anyway. I can’t look at you the same way anymore. I gave you a chance after the whole Genie thing 5 years ago, but this incident at the wedding was really the last straw. I gave you a huge last chance and I feel incredibly disrespected after what you talked about at my wedding. 

I don’t trust you around my wife or my future kids. At least the guy who might come out when you’re drinking. I wish things were different, but it’s the truth. 

I wanted to visit Boston and get to know you again as full grown adults, but I think that ship has sailed. I just don’t have it in me for 3rd chance. 

Please consider getting clean. I don’t know how much you drink or do drugs but I was alarmed when you were talking about it the last time we talked.

Even though we may never be the same, I still love you and it breaks my heart to know you have a pit inside you you’re trying to fill. I pray for you often and you have a great capability to save lives inside you. Both medically and personally. You’re brilliant and such a hard worker and I’m blessed to have known you. I know you’re destined to do wonderful things, but only if you follow the correct path. 

God’s designs are perfect, and I know he has something great in store for you, but you also have to want it to get there. 

Life is hard enough as it is and none of us have enough time. I think my trying to have a relationship with you is too hard for me right now and will be a net negative for me and take away from my everything to give the other other relationships in my life. I need to be selective to be my best for those who I love and those who love me. I wish things were different.
