Hi Tia,

We got these post cards from our first stop in Dubrovnik, which was a big filming location for game of thrones. This little boat was from an island called Hvar just off the coast of Croatia where we stayed for 3 days. It’s been inhabited since 2500 BC even before the Greeks. The artist shop was just down the hill from our airbnb. 

I want to call and catch up, I miss you.

Hi aunt Dianne,

We got this little boat was from an island called Hvar just off the coast of Croatia where we stayed for 3 days on our honeymoon. It’s been inhabited since 2500 BC even before the Greeks. The artist shop was just down the hill from our airbnb. 

Thinking of you,

David
