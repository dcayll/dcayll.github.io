Ceci,

You’ve opened up a whole new dimension of existence that I didn’t know existed. Sure you take up a lot of time and sleep but what you give back in love and fulfillment is orthogonal to that. Normally if you’re working towards a goal, your effort will be linear with the reward. But with a baby it’s almost like a different function altogether. Is like a constant high number. 

I’ve been telling people I feel like the grinch of Christmas when his heart grew 3 sizes. There was a capacity for love that I didn’t know about.
