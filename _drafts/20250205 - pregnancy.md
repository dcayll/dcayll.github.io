Two days ago was the positive test. It was surreal and felt like a mistake. Yesterday it started to sink in. Today it feels like a huge blessing. 

Our plans are no match for Gods plans and timing. 

I feel a renewed calling to move mountains for Isabel. I feel more protective and responsible. I can’t work so much because I need to support her. But I also want to work harder to support us financially

I feel more “us against the world”. With a child and a family, it’s more of a discreet unit in the world vs. just me and isa. Our team is forming.  

I want to tell everybody. I’m always praying for health and wellbeing for isa and the baby. 

I feel pressure now to be more put together and have everything in order

I worry that mommy and daddy won’t be that excited. In the same way Isabel thought I should have been more excited at the news.
