Hey man, I feel like I identify with your situation with Ian a lot and I would just implore you to pray about how to approach the relationship. In whatever way feels right to you. I think forgiveness and reconciliation can be very powerful for both parties involved. But any attempt won’t mean anything unless you come to that conclusion in yourself, so I just encourage you to pray in times like that. It’s in situations like that that I really found God and brought me closer to Him.
