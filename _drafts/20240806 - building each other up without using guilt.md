Hi beh

I want the best for you and I want you to want the best for you. I think we can agree on some endpoints: playing with the kids and being healthy in old age. I dont necessarily think we need to agree on the means to get there. I choose to lift and do the sauna. You don’t have to do that. I just want to emphasize that physical activity is important. 

Walking can be good! But many times it may not be high enough intensity to increase the heart rate and be cardio. I understand this is your first step and I shouldn’t be criticizing it. It is great that you have taken that first step the last week or two

I use guilt by default. How can I help motivate your internal drives? Are they there? I need you to tell me so I can help you in the way you need. I need to walk with you and encourage you. I think the answer is I need to meet you where you are and encourage you from there. Remind you you are doing the right things and to push yourself in the moment. Like a good trainer. We need to do things you’re interested in. I need to buy the tennis rackets and plan things on the weekends for us.
