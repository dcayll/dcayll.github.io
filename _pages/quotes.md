> God will not have his work manifest by cowards  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Ralph Waldo Emerson

> The universe is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow sharper  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — Eden Phillpotts

> At the end of your days, your life will have been what you have paid attention to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— William James

> Watch your thoughts, they become your words;  
Watch your words, they become your actions;  
Watch your actions, they become your habits;  
Watch your habits, they become your character;  
Watch your character, it becomes your destiny  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Lao Tzu

> The definition of hell is: Your last day on Earth, the person you became meets the person you could have become  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Dan Sullivan

> If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it

> Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope.  
Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith.  
Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love.  
No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as it is from our standpoint. Therefore we must be saved by the final form of love which is forgiveness.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Reinhold Niebuhr

> 53. Now as there are an infinity of possible universes in the ideas of God, and but one of them can exist, there must be a sufficient reason for the choice of God which determines him to select one rather than another.
> 54. And this reason is to be found only in the _fitness_ or in the degree of perfection which these worlds possess, each possible thing having the right to claim existence in proportion to the perfection which it involves.
> 55. This is the cause for the existence of the greatest good; namely, that the wisdom of God permits him to know it, his goodness causes him to choose it, and his power enables him to produce it.[[4]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds#cite_note-:1-4)
		- Gottfried Leibniz, Theodicy
