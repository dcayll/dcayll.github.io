## Fitness

I've been physically active for (mostly) my whole life, and fitness is one of my passions. I love to share my knowledge with others and love to invite friends to work out. I've been lifting weights since 2012, and it's been a long up and down journey full of cycles with good progress followed by injury and rehab and even slower progress back to the starting point. I'm humbled by the mistakes I've made and will continue to learn my entire life. The goal is to stay healthy for as long as possible. Just like in investing, time in market is the biggest determining factor in final wealth, similarly, years in gym is the bigget determining factor in strength and hypertrophy.

I'm not trying to live forever, but I want as many years as possible to be as high quality as possible. We lose muscle at a rate of 10%/decade as we age, and I'm hoping to get my initial number high enough so that I can squat down and pick up my grandkids at 80 and stave off the general pain associated with growing old.

### Bodybuilding

My fitness journey really started for the wrong reasons, but very common reasons for an awkward shy 15 year old. I wanted to get muscles to get girls and get respect from guys. Size was the only thing I cared about. That ended up biting me in the end, but I will never regret getting started that early because it is what spurred my lasting interest in fitness.

### Mobility

My two major injuries are impingement in my left shoulder from weak rotator cuffs and tight lat, pec, and suprispinatus muscles. Basically my left shoulder is rotated forward and looks higher than my right when at rest. This reduces space in the front part of the shoulder and causes ligaments to become "impinged" and rub against bone, muscle, and other ligaments and get inflamed. This is a very common issue in weight lifters, especially intermediate lifters who made a lot of gains early on with little respect for proper form (like me).

### Cardio

I like to be as efficient as possible when doing cardio, so I mostly do HIIT training (zone 5 I think). And this is also only when I'm trying to cut down. I'd like to add in some zone 2 cardio in the near future if I can fit it into my schedule conveniently.
