In this section, I'll be archving some of the important excersizes I do to keep my body and joints healthy. First, here is an overview of my fitness journey and how I got to where I am. 

I've been physically active for (mostly) my whole life, and fitness is one of my passions. I love to share my knowledge with others and invite friends to work out with me. I've been lifting weights since 2012, and it's been a long up and down journey with good progress followed by injury and rehab and slow progress again. The goal is to stay healthy for as long as possible. We lose muscle at a rate of 10%/decade as we age, and I'm hoping to get my initial number high enough so that I can squat down and pick up my grandkids at 80 and stave off as much general pain associated with aging.

### Injuries

My first major injury was impingement in my left shoulder from weak rotator cuffs and tight lat, pec, and rotator cuff muscles. Basically my left shoulder is rotated forward and looks higher than my right when at rest. This reduces space in the front part of the shoulder and causes ligaments to become "impinged", or rub against bone, muscle, or other ligaments, and get inflamed. This is a very common issue in weight lifters and takes constant postural correction. 

My second major injury was from deadlifting with poor form. I was diagnosed with spondylolysis, which is the fracture of a small bone in the lumbar spine. The only cure is to strengthen the core (or surgery to fuse the bones together, which is a last resort)
