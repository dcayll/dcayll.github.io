I got a Sony a6100 Fall of 2020, and it is a great entry level camera so far. I picked it becuase it is a relatively small form factor and lenses are common and affordable for the sony E-mount size. I enjoy taking photos of nature and staging photos well when people ask me to take one for them (also complain when people misframe a photo I want taken). Recently, I haven't been using my Sony as much becuase, honestly, my iPhone takes pretty good pictures in most common scenarios. Many times even better than what I can do on the Sony. So I've shifted my photography focus onto things that my iPhone cant do (yet). Below is a full collection of all photogarphy posts so far:
