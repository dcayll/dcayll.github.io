Macro photography is taking pictures of very small things. I especially enjoy seeing the intricacies of flowers, plants, insects or other things we never think to examine up close. The way succulent leaves bud, the way a flower's pedals unfold around it's center. iPhone cameras don't have the close focus and zoom capabilities and it means I need my Sony. I haven't actually bought a macro lens yet, I just use a "close-up" filter which is a convex lens that introduces a diopter to the optical path (like corrective lenses), which changes the focal point of the image. In my case, it moves the focal point closer to the lens, so the sample can be placed closer to the lens and zoomed in better. I use this lens along with my telephoto kit lens to get the zoom required. Below is a collection of my Macrophotography and techniques:
