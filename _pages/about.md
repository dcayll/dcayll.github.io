I'm currently a PhD student at the Univeristy of Texas at Austin in the
Nanoscale Design and Manufacturing lab. I'm also working part time as an R&D
Engineer at GraphAudio inc, a small start-up based in Austin. In my spare time
I enjoy being outdoors, riding motorcycles, lifting weights, practicing macro
and astro photography, and learning about macro economics and monetary policy.
This website is for organizing my random thoughts and hobbies, and hopefully
these things may be helpful to others.
