Astrophotography means taking pictures of stars and other things in space. Christmas 2021 I got a star tracker that follows the rotation of the earth when aligned correctly. This is necessary because the stars and nebulae are very dim and require very long exposures, sometimes from 5 min up to hours. This means the rotation of the earth makes the stars look like streaks in the image and limit your exposure time. It is a difficult and time consuming hobby because you need to be up late and keep your eyes on the weather forecast becuase clouds or humidity in the air can cause visibility issues. Below is a collection of my Astrophotography images and processing techniques:
