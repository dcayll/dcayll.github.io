Lead with love

Let he who is without sin cast the first stone

I’m the one who I don’t want seeing her

All the men are fallen and looking. Not all but many

They’re only for my eyes and I feel like allowing others to see is akin to being a cuck

Allowing others to see is akin to OF as well. Would not be okay with me. 

Similar reaction to not allowing OF to not allowing nude beach. I’m self conscious and not secure with myself. 

It’s good that you respected my opinions and didn’t make it a big deal. I felt heard

Why did you want to do it in the first place? That’s what makes me uncomfortable. Freedom? 

Why were you so timid with me and wouldn’t let me see you and even now sometimes you’re shy but you were not shy at all at the beach.
