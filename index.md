I'm currently a process development engineer at Qorvo inc. in Richardson, TX. I started in May 2023 in the thin films group and I've been focusing on Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) processes used in the fabrication of [BAW filter](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjcmeXq3e-DAxVDlGoFHWVYDbkQFnoECBAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.qorvo.com%2Fresources%2Fd%2Fqorvo-advanced-baw-filter-technology-impact-on-5g-white-paper&usg=AOvVaw1b5Bq5eRPlMtFMwcV_ALT5&opi=89978449) technology. 

In my spare time I enjoy being outdoors, riding motorcycles, lifting weights, practicing macro and astro photography, and learning about macro economics and monetary policy. This website is for organizing my interests and hobbies in hopes that it may be useful to myself and others down the road.

I especially like and agree with Paul Graham's short essay on writing, [Writing, Briefly](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html). He argues not enough of us write, and the mere process of writing generates new ideas, along with sharpening and sculpting existing ideas. I will use this website as a public place to write my ideas which will force me to refine my thoughts with organization and structure, with a beginning and an end. I'll try to include references and relevant analysis to be as helpful as possible to potential readers.

Well, I'm a blogger now. Thanks for reading!
